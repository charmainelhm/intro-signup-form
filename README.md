## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Use Constrain Validation API to check validity of form input
- Event listener can be used to listen to form submission
- Use preventDefault() method to prevent page from refreshing when form is submitted

### Useful resources

- [Form Validation Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) - This is a lifesaver for me in understand how form input can be validated
- [Constrain Validation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Constraint_validation) - To-go document for reference when using the API
